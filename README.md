# Invoice-Information-Extractor
This tool automatically extracts key invoice fields from PDF files, including GST details, consignor/consignee info, and invoice value. It uses OCR (Tesseract) to read scanned invoices, sends the extracted text to Mistral AI for parsing, and exports the structured data to an Excel file â€” streamlining invoice processing for businesses.
